  Alls our styles

  Please see https://github.com/inuitcss/getting-started for more information on our CSS structure.

  We'll also be following many practices listed here: http://cssguidelin.es/

@charset "UTF-8";

// Fonts: Serve up our fonts so that all users will have them
@import "fonts";

// Settings: Global variables, site-wide settings, config switches, etc.
@import "settings";


// Tools: Site-wide mixins and functions.
@import "tools";


//Generic: Low-specificity, far-reaching rulesets (e.g. resets).
@import "generic";


// Base: Unclassed HTML elements (e.g. a {}, blockquote {}, address {}).
@import "base";


// Objects: Objects, abstractions, and design patterns (e.g. .media {}).
@import "objects";

// Components: One-off CSS rules for specific parts of the UI.
@import "components";


// Libs: Help out external libraries that conflict with our CSP settings. Put after the others so we can extend as needed.
@import "libs";


// Trumps: High-specificity, very explicit selectors. Overrides and helper classes (e.g. .hidden {}).
@import "trumps";


// Shame: Things put in place for rapid development. This file should nearly always be empty after PRs.
@import "shame";
